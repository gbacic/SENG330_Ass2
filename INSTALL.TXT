#TechnoGYM 1.0 super alpha

Only java is required to run this program. 

The program cam be compiled by typing:

javac *.java in the root folder of the project.

The Program can be run by typing:

java TechnoGym

if google protocol buffers are implemented in a future version, and the classes are not compiled,
the can be compiled buy using protocl buffers compiler protoc.

Protoc can by run by typing:

protoc --java_out=. techno.proto 

--java.out=. will output the same name as the input file, as a class, in this case techno.class under the package foler TechnoGym.


Thank you.
